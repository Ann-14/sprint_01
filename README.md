# ITACADEMY (sprint_01)
This respositori contains the first level of a total of nine levels 
that will complete the bootcamp's itinerary.
In this first level I've tried to copy a layout that was given to us by using
css and html. I've started using media queries in order to build a responsive design.
Lastly, I've also included some easy @keyframes effects to learn about their implementation and style declarations.
